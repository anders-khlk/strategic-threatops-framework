## 🧭 Overview

STOF (Strategic ThreatOps Framework) is a conceptual model designed to elevate cyber threat intelligence (CTI) beyond reactive analysis. It aligns threat insights with long-range decision-making, helping organizations proactively manage strategic risk.

---

## 🎯 Purpose and Scope

- **Target Audience**: CTI teams, CISOs, Strategic Planners, and Cyber Defense Architects.
- **Scope**: Strategic alignment of intelligence, adversary modeling, and defensive planning.

---

## ⚖️ Core Principles

- **Adversary-Centric Thinking**
- **Strategic Alignment of Intelligence**
- **Decision-Oriented Outputs**
- **Scalability Across Maturity Levels**

## 🧱 Framework Structure

### 1. Strategic Threat Analysis

- Threat horizon scanning
- Strategic scenario development
- Intelligence requirement setting

### 2. Adversary Profiling

- Threat actor objectives and capability mapping
- Strategic-level TTP patterns
- Adversary decision loops (OODA, etc.)

### 3. Intelligence-Driven Defense

- Strategic intelligence to control selection mapping
- Threat-informed architecture
- Intelligence feedback loops

### 4. Strategic Response Planning

- Decision wargaming
- Crisis simulation and tabletop exercises
- Strategy-to-capability alignment

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

- National cyber strategy development
- Threat-driven cyber investment planning
- Maturity modeling for CTI teams

---

## 🔗 Integration with CTI and SOC

- Works alongside MITRE ATT&CK and NIST CSF
- Can guide PIRs and intelligence production
- Enables strategic SOC planning and prioritization

---

## 🧬 Extending STOF

- Future modules: geopolitical threat integration, supply chain risk, cross-sector use
